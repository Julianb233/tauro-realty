    question: "How do I know when it's the right time to sell?",
    answer:
      "The best time to sell depends on your personal circumstances and market conditions. In Philadelphia, spring (March–May) and early fall (September–October) see the highest buyer activity. However, well-priced homes sell year-round. Key indicators include strong equity position, low local inventory, rising home values in your area, and personal readiness. A LYL agent can provide a free market analysis to help you decide.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much is my home worth?",
    answer:
      "Your home's value depends on recent comparable sales, current market conditions, your property's condition, and location-specific factors. Online estimates (Zillow, Redfin) provide a rough starting point, but they can be off by 5–15%. A LYL agent will prepare a detailed Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) based on actual sold data, pending sales, and hyperlocal market knowledge—at no cost or obligation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to sell a home in Philadelphia?",
    answer:
      "The average days on market in Philadelphia varies by neighborhood and price point, but well-priced homes with strong marketing typically receive offers within 6–14 days. From listing to closing, the full process usually takes 60–90 days. Preparation time (staging, repairs, photography) adds 1–3 weeks before going live.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the costs of selling a home?",
    answer:
      "Typical seller costs in Philadelphia include: agent commissions (5–6% of sale price), seller's transfer tax (2.075%), title insurance, any agreed-upon buyer credits or repairs, outstanding mortgage payoff, and potential capital gains tax. Your net proceeds can be estimated in advance—ask your LYL agent for a detailed seller net sheet.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I make repairs or renovations before listing?",
    answer:
      "Focus on high-ROI improvements: fresh paint, updated lighting, clean landscaping, and fixing obvious maintenance issues (leaky faucets, broken hardware). Major renovations rarely recoup 100% of their cost. Your LYL agent will do a walkthrough and recommend the specific improvements that will have the greatest impact on your sale price and timeline.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to stage my home?",
    answer:
      "Staged homes consistently sell faster and for more money—studies show staged properties sell for 5–10% more than unstaged ones. At minimum, declutter, depersonalize, and deep clean. For vacant properties or homes that need extra visual appeal, LYL Realty Group can coordinate professional staging services tailored to your budget and target buyer demographic.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my home doesn't sell?",
    answer:
      "If your home isn't attracting offers, the most common culprit is pricing. Your LYL agent will monitor showing feedback, online activity metrics, and comparable sales data to recommend strategic adjustments. Options include price adjustments, enhanced marketing, staging updates, or targeting a different buyer segment. We work with you until your home is sold.",

                Every pricing recommendation starts with a deep-dive CMA. Your

                listings, expired listings, and market absorption rates in your
                specific neighborhood. This data-driven approach ensures your

                Philadelphia&apos;s real estate market shifts by season,
                neighborhood, and price point. In a seller&apos;s market with
                low inventory, aggressive pricing can trigger bidding wars. In a
                balanced or buyer&apos;s market, strategic pricing slightly
                below comparable sales attracts more showings and can still
                generate multiple offers.

              <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                Buyers search in price brackets. A home listed at $505,000
                misses every buyer searching up to $500,000. Strategic price
                positioning ensures your listing appears in the maximum number
                of search results. The first two weeks on market generate the
                most activity, so getting the price right from day one is
                critical to maximizing competition and final sale price.

                Overpriced homes sit on the market, accumulate days on market,
                and eventually sell for less than they would have at the correct
                price. Buyers view stale listings with suspicion and submit
                lowball offers. LYL Realty Group&apos;s data-first approach avoids this
                trap and positions your home to sell quickly at maximum value.

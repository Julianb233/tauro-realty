      "Down payment requirements depend on your loan type. Conventional loans require as little as 3%, FHA loans 3.5%, and VA/USDA loans may require 0% down. Pennsylvania also offers assistance programs like the Keystone Advantage Assistance Loan that can provide up to $6,000 toward your down payment and closing costs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the home buying process take?",
    answer:
      "From pre-approval to closing, the typical timeline is 45–90 days. Pre-approval takes 1–2 weeks, the home search varies based on inventory and your criteria, and once you're under contract, closing usually happens within 30–45 days.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are closing costs and how much should I budget?",
    answer:
      "Closing costs in Philadelphia typically range from 2–5% of the purchase price. They include title insurance, lender origination fees, recording fees, prepaid taxes and insurance, and the city's 2.075% buyer transfer tax. Your lender will provide a detailed Closing Disclosure at least three business days before settlement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I get a home inspection?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. A professional home inspection costs $300–$500 and can uncover costly issues like foundation problems, roof damage, outdated electrical, plumbing leaks, or mold. In Philadelphia's older housing stock, inspections are especially critical. The findings give you leverage to negotiate repairs or credits with the seller.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval?",
    answer:
      "Pre-qualification is an informal estimate based on self-reported financial information. Pre-approval involves a full credit check, income verification, and documentation review by a lender—resulting in a conditional commitment for a specific loan amount. Sellers take pre-approved buyers much more seriously, especially in competitive markets.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a real estate agent to buy a home?",
    answer:
      "While not legally required, having an experienced buyer's agent is strongly recommended. Your agent provides market expertise, negotiation skills, and guidance through complex paperwork—at no cost to you, since the seller typically pays both agents' commissions. A LYL agent's local Philadelphia knowledge is especially valuable in navigating neighborhood dynamics and pricing.",
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need to buy a home?",
    answer:
      "Minimum credit score requirements vary by loan type: 620 for conventional loans, 580 for FHA loans (or 500 with 10% down), and no official minimum for VA loans (though most lenders prefer 620+). Higher scores unlock better interest rates—a score of 740+ typically qualifies you for the best available terms.",

              <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                The most common mortgage type, conventional loans are offered by
                private lenders and typically require a minimum credit score of
                620 and a down payment of 3-20%. If you put less than 20% down,
                you&apos;ll pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) until you reach
                20% equity. Conventional loans offer competitive rates and
                flexible terms of 15 or 30 years.

              <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
                Backed by the Federal Housing Administration, FHA loans are
                popular with first-time buyers because they accept credit scores
                as low as 580 with just 3.5% down. They have more flexible
                qualifying requirements but include an upfront mortgage insurance
                premium and annual mortgage insurance for the life of the loan.

                Available to eligible veterans, active-duty service members, and
                surviving spouses, VA loans offer outstanding terms: zero down
                payment, no PMI, and competitive interest rates. If you&apos;ve

                insurance, and competitive rates. While most of Philadelphia
                proper doesn&apos;t qualify, several surrounding areas in
                Montgomery, Bucks, and Chester counties are eligible, making

                offers reduced mortgage insurance and below-market rates.

                    Your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly
                    income. Most lenders prefer a DTI of 43% or lower. The lower

                  <p className="mt-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                    Your credit score directly affects your interest rate. A
                    score of 740+ typically gets the best rates. Even a small
                    rate difference can mean tens of thousands of dollars over
                    the life of your loan.

                  <p className="mt-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                    A rate lock guarantees your interest rate for a set period
                    (typically 30-60 days) while your loan processes. In a
                    rising-rate environment, locking early can save you
                    significant money.
